When you click on Let's Get Started, you will go to the project's main page and produce the products as you like want and organize the products as you want. They will appear in the form of a table and you can modify or delete them. Or delete all products, but you must enter a specific password in order to be able to do this through the Clear All button that appears when there are products.
